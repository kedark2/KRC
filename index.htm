							<h2><a href="#">Information about college</a></h2>
							<p>Kedar and Ritu Higher Secondary School / College is a unique institution designed to disseminate quality education to students. Nearly twenty three years of its wonderful performance has undoubtedly made Kedar and Ritu Secondary Boarding School (our junior school section) famous as one of the foremost education institutions in Finland. Many students who have been trained within its walls have been leading their successful lives in different walks of life.The inspiration derived from this outstanding success in managing the school, quite naturally, has led us to conduct a college of our own, hence Kedar and Ritu College (KRC). The atmosphere of KRC positively enhances the learning process of students. It is situated in the quiet atmosphere away from the hustle and bustle of city life near Pengerkatu, within easy reach of major locations of Kokkola . Peaceful, safe, independent cafeteria, spacious sports field and friendly academic environments are the essence that makes KRC unique as ideal study centre.
